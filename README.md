This is a demonstration of Guava features. It draws a lot from Daniel Hinojosa's guava demo project on GitHub (https://github.com/dhinojosa/usingguava)

Most of the example code is in src/test/java/

I am using JUnit so I can execute small chunks of code conviently. These are mean to demonstrate Guava and are not examples of good unit tests.
